# MongoDB Empty Query Result Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult to debug, issue in MongoDB queries:  receiving an empty result set even when documents should match the query criteria.  This is usually caused by an error in the construction of the query itself, specifically related to regular expressions, comparison operators, or field names.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic query, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version.  Examine both files to understand the cause and fix of this problem.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
2. Create a MongoDB database and collection.
3. Insert some documents with matching fields.
4. Execute the query in `bug.js` against the collection.
5. Observe that the query returns an empty array, even if matching documents exist.  The debug messages will help pinpoint the problem.

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the specific error in the query.  Remember to adapt the solution to your own particular query and data structure.
